# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

from time import sleep

print("Hello " + input("What is your name..? "))

# Basically what happens here, is that when the computer is running the python script, and it see's an input function, it runs the input first, and then the OTHER function, replacing the input question, with the answer.
# In this case, we replace "What is your name..?", with "Rob"
